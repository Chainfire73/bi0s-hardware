1. ## solving logic gates

   - For the blub to light up the final AND should output high.
     For the AND input from upper part of the circuit to be high,
     D must be high and atleast one among A,B,C should be high.
     Form the bottom part we get values of A,B and C (1,0,0)

   - Solving the next part is really straight forward.

   b = (1000 1110)decimal = 142

   a = (1001 1110)decimal = 158

2. ## simulator

   After entering values of a and b flag pops up in the display!

   **FLAG=EF**
